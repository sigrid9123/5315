      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a tool designed to create, deploy and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies and ship it all out as one package. 
      In a way, docker is like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows application to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they are running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computers. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Nginx is an open-source web server that is also used as a reverse proxy. HTTP cache and load balancer. It was originally created by Igor Sysoev in 2004. Because its roots are in performance optimization under scale, Nginx often outperforms other popular web servers in benchmark tests, especially in situations with static content and/or high concurrent requests.

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine is a software computer that, like a physical computer, runs an operating system and applications. The virtual machine is comprised of a set of specification and configuration files and is backed by the physical resources of a host. It runs in a window, much like any other program, giving the end user the same experience on a virtual machine as they would have on the host operating system itself. The virtual machine is sandboxed from the rest of the system, meaning that the software inside a virtual machine can’t escape or tamper with the computer itself. This produces an ideal environment for testing other operating systems including beta releases, accessing virus-infected data, creating operating system backups, and running software or applications on operating systems they weren’t originally intended for.
