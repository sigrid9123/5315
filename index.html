      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker is a tool designed to create, deploy and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies and ship it all out as one package. 
      In a way, docker is like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows application to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they are running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computers. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.
